***Description***

There are 4 researches and corresponding predictions which I have worked on based on the topics listed below:

1. Prediction of having marriage affair using Fair's Affairs dataset.
2. Prediction of murder rates across the USA using internal R dataset for States.
3. Prediction of getting Breast Cancer using Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
4. Prediction of car milage using internal R dataset for Auto.

I have created and compared multiple statistical models in order to arrive at the best statistical model for prediction. I have also done data exploration and answered many research questions along the way.

*** Note*** 

1. These predictions are ONLY valid in the context of the datasets I have analyzed here and SHOULD NOT be extended the entire domain.
2. I have done the research and predictions listed here as part of course work for Data Science (Autumn 2015) at the University of Washington.
To start off, let us load the required libraries:
